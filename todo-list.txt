- Allow flags in test cases
  - and speed and expected result
- add wrap
- add deterministic functions
- mutually recursive functions
- mu type parameters (must be careful about divergence from eager evaluation of the type)
- benchmarking setup
- language docs
- typechecking pipeline from splaying to non-splaying
  (and optional skip of splaying mode to check pure refutation performance)
- refactor to have labels as different types so there is less `bad_input_env` stuff
  (we want pattern checking exhaustiveness in left/right and check/eval cases)
- port more bluejay tests over
- port liquid haskell and idris tests

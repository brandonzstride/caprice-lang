- add wrap
  (added, but need to specially check wrapped things and also wrap lazily generate things)
- add deterministic functions
- mutually recursive functions
- mu type parameters (must be careful about divergence from eager evaluation of the type)
- benchmarking setup
- language docs
- typechecking pipeline from splaying to non-splaying
  (and optional skip of splaying mode to check pure refutation performance)
- check only one statement given an initial environment
- port liquid haskell and idris tests
